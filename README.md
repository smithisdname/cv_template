# CV/Resume Template

## Project Profile

There is a need for a one-pager CV for our high school graduates. This is because people with little to no experience tend to have the bulkiest Resumes. The director of the High school association In Rwanda is looking for a basic template which will help high school graduates to build their short CVs.

### Tasks:
    - reproduce the below design using CSS & Html (and JS if required)
    - The Head (title & image) should be fixed
    - The rest should be scrollable
    - I should be able to view it on mobile devices. (Use the browser inspect to check mobile)
    - When I click on the main title. The color should change randomly
    - Host it on either Github pages, netlify or vercel.

NB: try to reproduce the fonts and colors as they appear at the maximum.

Check the following figma design and develop the page 100% accurate using html & css:

You might need to sign up/login with your google account to be able to view that perfectly.
